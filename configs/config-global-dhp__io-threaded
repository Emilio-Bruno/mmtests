### tiobench is executed in this configuration for up to 16 threads and
### executed thress times to estimate variance. It is known that tiobench
### has some flaws that make it unsuitable as an IO benchmark except for
### historical reasons. The primary problem is that the read portion of
### the benchmark takes place after the write without dumping the cache.
### The performance is then related to how much data is still in the page
### cache. Older kernels had a bug whereby old pages were artifically
### preserved in memory which boosted this benchmarks figures even though
### the kernel was buggy. If this happens, it tends to be visible as
### read performance that is higher than the physical capability of the disk.
